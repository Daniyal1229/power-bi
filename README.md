    <h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
    <p>To get started with the Power BI dashboards, you will need to have Power BI Desktop installed on your machine. Power BI Desktop is a free application that allows you to create and publish interactive reports and dashboards.</p>
    <p>If you don't have Power BI Desktop installed, you can download it from the official <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/">Power BI website</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="features">Features</h2>

        <li>Customizable dashboards: You can customize the dashboards to meet your specific requirements by adding or removing visualizations, creating calculated measures, and applying filters.</li>
        <li>Collaboration and sharing: Power BI allows you to collaborate with your team by sharing dashboards and reports. You can also publish your dashboards to the Power BI service for wider distribution.</li>
